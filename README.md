### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

If you are a Developer, never minds which language you'll use to write  ...


If ( there is an issue) <br>
then { <br>
  if we are technically evaluated enough to build the solution <br>
  =>  <br>
  the solution exists <br>
  => I'll find it ! <br>
  } <br>
  else  <br>
  { we need some more time for research... } <br>
